# Tech Careers Research Project

**Team Members: Danielius Karalius, Tristan Michalek**

**Date: 10/16/2025** 

**Submission Guidelines:** Your team can work on this together but you all have to get a copy of it and push it to your GitHub repo, main folder/repo htmlCssJavaScript, in a subfolder you will call **"careerResearchProject"**.  This will be just a copy and filled out version of this markdown file.  You're just filling in the questions with your own added text. 


## Introduction

The skills you're learning in this class—programming, databases, web design, and AI/ML—open doors to many different career paths. While you might think "tech job" means one thing, the reality is much more diverse. Some roles focus heavily on writing code, others on analyzing data, and still others on designing user experiences or building intelligent systems.

In this project, you'll research **different career paths** to understand:
- What professionals in these roles actually *do* day-to-day
- What education and skills are required
- What the career outlook and salary ranges look like
- Which aspects of your current coursework connect to each role

Your goal is to explore **2 careers** as a team and compare them to help you think about potential future paths.

## Career Comparison & Reflection

### Comparison Table
Create a quick comparison of the careers you researched:

| Career Title | Starting Salary | Education Required | Most Important Skill | Job Growth |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------|
|Front End Developer | $142,000 |Bachelor's | Having creativity and putting words into practice in the form of a website or unique visual for the user. |13%|
|Software Developer| $132,508 |Bachelor's| Being able to program and debug, along with understanding data structures. |18%|


### Team Discussion Questions (Fill in your answers)

**1. Which career was most interesting to your team and why?**

**Both were pretty cut and dry, but it seems like the Software Developer specifically has to worry about data structures and other extra tidbits, while the Web Developer gets to worry about how the final product will look, and if it is suitable for a user. Technically though, that can be applied to software as well.**


**2. Which career seems like the best fit for someone who loves the programming/coding aspects of this class?**

**That depends on if the individual themselves has a vision for creativity. A creative software could be possible, but a creative website can also be possible as well. It truly just does depend on if the person prefers to be more "artsy" as opposed to having to meddle with data structures.**


**3. Which career seems like the best fit for someone who prefers working with data and analysis?**

**Just like earlier, this one is more fit for the Software Developer. The web developer specifically is more focused on the visuals of the project, while Software Developers do get to develop software (ironic), but they also have to understand analysis and data.**


**4. What surprised you most about these careers?**

**It was obvious that there is a certain creativity associated with both of the careers. However, the inclusion of databases is what is surprising, since software can include important data, but to such an extent was not what was expected.**


**5. Based on your research, what additional skills or knowledge would be valuable to develop?**

**The soft skills in general are VERY crucial to surviving the workplace world, considering that if someone has horrible teamwork skills, then an entire project could be put to jeopardy all because of one person.**
